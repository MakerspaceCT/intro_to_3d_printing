# Intro to 3D Printing with the Prusa i3 MK3S

from Prusa3D.com:

> The original Prusa i3 MK3S is the "BEST 3D PRINTER" according to ALL3DP.COM and MAKE: Magazine, where MK3S also received "Editor's Choice" as the highest-rated 3D Printer in the 2019 Digital Fabrication Guide. The MK3S features a rebuilt extruder, numerous sensors, and various smart features. Plus, a new magnetic MK52 heatbed with replaceable PEI Spring Steel Print Sheet. Dozens of various tweaks and upgrades improve the reliability and ease of use.

> MK3S's functionality can be further expanded with the unique Multi-Material Upgrade 2.0 Addon for printing with up to 5 materials simultaneously.

# I have a 3D model and I just want to get started.

See [**this guide from Prusa Research**](https://manual.prusa3d.com/Guide/How+to+import+profiles+to+Cura+4.x+(Windows+&+macOS)/1421) on setting up Cura 4.x on your Windows, MacOS, or Linux PC.

Are you a Chromebook school? Give Astroprint a try. See [this post](https://forum.astroprint.com/t/using-chromebook-for-3d-printing/4687/2) for a quick overview of the process. We're working on a better guide for this, which will be forthcoming.

# What should I 3D Print? How do I create a model?

## What if I just want to find and print a model someone else created?
[Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com/explore/popular) is a great place to get started. Here are some to get started with:

* [XYZ 20mm Calibration Cube](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1278865)
* [#3DBenchy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622) - #3DBenchy is a model specifically designed for testing 3D printers.
* [Baby Groot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2014307)
* [Three Cube Gears](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:213946)


## Creating a 3D model.
If you want to create your own 3D models, check out the following pieces of software. You should be able to find YouTube tutorials for any of these.
* [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) - simple tool for 3D modeling.
* [Autodesk Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) - professional parametric* CAD. Free for personal use.

*"parametric" means that you capture design intent using features and constraints, and this allows users to automate repetitive changes, such as those found in families of product parts. [Check out this video for an overview of pros and cons of parametric modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRZIMnUf3gA).*


# Software

## Slicing
Slicers are used to generate GCODE, machine code that the 3D Printers can understand. There are a few different options, which will net you similar results.
* [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) - this is what we use at MakerspaceCT.
* [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/) - the slicer maintained by the Prusa team, based on the open-source project [Slic3r](https://slic3r.org/).
## Other
* [3D Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6) - If you're using a Windows PC, 3D Builder is a great tool for rotating, scaling, or fixing "invalidly defined" 3D prints.
