This outline is broken into several sections to provide you some tips and help with your 3D Printing:

# What should I 3D Print? How do I create a model?

If you want to create your own 3D models, check out the following pieces of software. You should be able to find YouTube tutorials for any of these.
* TinkerCad - simple tool for 3D modeling.
* Autodesk Fusion360 - professional parametric* CAD. Free for personal use.


*"parametric" means that you capture design intent using features and constraints, and this allows users to automate repetitive changes, such as those found in families of product parts.
